# React + Typescript Starter Kits

1. <https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript> is the officially recommended Typescript fork of `create-react-app`.
2. <https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-parcel> works with Typescript out of the box.
3. <https://github.com/basarat/typescript-react/tree/master/01%20bootstrap> for manual setup of React + Typescript + Webpack + Babel

In particular, make sure that you have `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` installed. [Read more about the DefinitelyTyped project if you are unfamiliar](https://definitelytyped.org/)
