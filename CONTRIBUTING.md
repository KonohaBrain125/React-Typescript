# So you want to contribute!

Thanks for helping out the community! We are actively looking for contributors and maintainers so you are more than welcome.

I thought I should lay out some core principles that we will follow so that this repo doesn't get too wild and lose its value.

1. **We are a CHEATSHEET above all**: all examples to be as simple as possible, easily searched, and presented for copy-and-paste.
2. **Collapsible explanations**: No more than 1-2 sentences of explanation, any more than that we put inside `details` tags.
3. **React + Typescript ONLY**: React's ecosystem is huge, we can't possibly cover it all. This includes Redux. Would encourage people to maintain separate lists for stuff like React + Apollo Graphql, for example.

That's all I've got! Again, really happy you are thinking about helping out, who knows, the person who you might be helping is yourself in future!
