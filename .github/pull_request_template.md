Thanks for contributing!

- **If you are making a significant PR**, please make sure there is an open issue first
- **If you're just fixing typos or adding small notes**, a brief explanation of why you'd like to add it would be nice :)

**If you are contributing to README.md, DON'T**. README.md is auto-generated. Please just make edits to the source inside of `/docs/basic`. _Sorry, we get that it is a slight pain._
